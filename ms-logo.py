# METHOD #1
# Modify the shader to color based on model normal
# To do this we have to modify the vertex shader
# to pass the normal in model coordinates
# through to the fragment shader. By default the normal
# is converted to View coordinates and then passed on.
# We keep that, but add a varying for the original normal.
# Then we modify the fragment shader to set the diffuse color
# based on that normal. First lets modify the vertex
# shader
planeMapper.AddShaderReplacement(
    vtk.vtkShader.Vertex,
    "//VTK::Normal::Dec", # replace the normal block
    True, # before the standard replacements
    "//VTK::Normal::Dec\n" # we still want the default
    "  varying vec3 temp;\n"
    #"  vec4 gl_Position;\n"
    "  varying vec3 myNormalMCVSOutput;\n", #but we add this
    False # only do it once
)
planeMapper.AddShaderReplacement(
    vtk.vtkShader.Vertex,
    "//VTK::Normal::Impl", # replace the normal block
    True, # before the standard replacements
    "//VTK::Normal::Impl\n" # we still want the default
    "  myNormalMCVSOutput = vec3(gl_Position.x,gl_Position.y,0.0);\n", #but we add this
    False # only do it once
)
# now modify the fragment shader
planeMapper.AddShaderReplacement(
    vtk.vtkShader.Fragment,  # in the fragment shader
    "//VTK::Normal::Dec", # replace the normal block
    True, # before the standard replacements
    "//VTK::Normal::Dec\n" # we still want the default
    "  varying vec3 myNormalMCVSOutput;\n", #but we add this
    False # only do it once
)
planeMapper.AddShaderReplacement(
    vtk.vtkShader.Fragment,  # in the fragment shader
    "//VTK::Normal::Impl", # replace the normal block
    True, # before the standard replacements
    "//VTK::Normal::Impl\n" # we still want the default calc
    "  diffuseColor = abs(myNormalMCVSOutput);\n", #but we add this
    False # only do it once
